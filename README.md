Overview

This project implements a simple library to track the live scores of the World Cup football matches. The solution focuses on simplicity, adhering to good software design principles such as Clean Code and SOLID principles. Itâ€™s built using an in-memory data structure (e.g., collections in Python) to store the information related to the scores of each match.
Project Requirements

    Live Scoreboard: The library should allow tracking the score of ongoing football matches in real-time.
    In-memory Store: Data is stored in memory using simple collections (e.g., dictionaries, lists) rather than a database or external storage solution.
    Test-Driven Development (TDD): The implementation follows TDD principles. Unit tests are used to verify the correctness of the functionality.
    Object-Oriented Design: The code adheres to Object-Oriented principles, ensuring maintainable, extendable, and clean code.
    SOLID Principles: The design follows SOLID principles to make the code modular and easily testable.

Features

    Track scores of football matches in real-time.
    Update match status (ongoing, finished) and the current score.
    Handle edge cases (e.g., match score resets, invalid inputs).
    Provide a simple API to interact with the scores.

Code Quality:

    The code follows SOLID principles and is organized in an object-oriented manner.
    Test-Driven Development (TDD): Unit tests are written to ensure the functionality works correctly.
    Clean and well-documented code with proper error handling.
